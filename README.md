## Overview

This program is a Golang REST API service that allows a user to shorten a URL. It also has the capability to redirect that user to the long URL after inputting the previously generated shortened URL.

## Specifications

This program is available on port 8080. It responds to a POST request with endpoint "/shorten." The request should be formatted in JSON otherwise an error will be thrown. The respose will also be in JSON and will contain a shortened URL that is randomly generated by the program and stored in a map.

The other feature of this program is redirection. If a user makes a GET request with endpoint "/$ID" (ID being the randomaly generated ID) of the format "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ID" then the program will 302 redirect that user to the long form of the URL.

## Testing

This program was tested using Postman to generate POST and GET requests.
